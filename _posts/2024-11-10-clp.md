 <p>Let's be real - in the world of digital forensics, mastering the command line is no longer just a nice-to-have, it's a must. Sure, those fancy GUI tools are great and all, but when the data hits the fan, you need to be able to navigate the command prompt like a Jedi. For those looking to get started with this critical skill, the Command Line Principles (CLP) course at the National Computer Forensics Institute (NCFI) offers an intensive, one-week training designed to give you a crash course of practical expertise needed to conduct forensic investigations using the command line in Windows environments. We began learning the basics of CLI then quickly graduated to utilizing Powershell. The majority of the course was spent in Powershell; learning how attackers utilize this tool for malice, using Powershell to locate attacks, and by the final day composing our own Powershell scripts for task automation (and maybe some hijinks back home)! Think of it like this: If CLI is like a pocket tool, than Powershell is your lightsaber, my friend. With it, you can slice through complex tasks, automate repetitive ones, and keep that digital evidence safe and sound. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> Why Learn the Command Line? </h2>

<p>In digital forensics and incident response, time and your digital footprint are of the utmost importance. During an investigation, data can be volatile, disappearing at any moment. System artifacts such as running processes, event logs, security logs, memory contents, and network connections are often only accessible for a short period before they are destroyed, lost, or overwritten. This makes it essential for forensics professionals to be proficient in quickly and efficiently acquiring volatile data and performing forensic imaging. The command line interface (CLI) offers the precision and speed that forensic investigators need, especially when time is critical. </p>

<p>The NCFI's Command Line Principles course is designed to equip students with the foundational knowledge and practical skills to use the Windows command line effectively. Whether you're a novice or someone with limited experience in the CLI environment, this course will help you gain the confidence and capability to perform a wide range of forensic tasks. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> What You'll Learn: </h2>

<p>The Command Line Principles course is a hands-on, immersive program that starts from the basics and gradually builds up to more advanced tasks. Here's a breakdown of the key skills and concepts you can expect to learn during the week:

<ul>
    <li> Creating and Managing Files and Directories - Learn how to create, modify, and delete files from the command line. This fundamental skill helps you organize and structure forensic data in a controlled and systematic manner.
 </li>
    <li> File Operations - Gain experience in using commands to efficiently copy, move, and back up important data across systems during an investigation. The ability to automate these processes is key to handling large datasets or performing repetitive tasks in forensic investigations.</li>
    <li> Formatting Drives and Preparing Evidence - Understand how to format drives, partition them, and prepare them for imaging or further analysis. This includes using disk management tools from the command line to securely prepare storage media for evidence acquisition.
</li>
    <li> Capturing Memory - Learn how to capture volatile memory (RAM) from a running system. Volatile memory contains important information about running processes, network connections, and system activity, all of which can be crucial to an investigation. </li>
    <li> Locating and Acquiring Volatile System Data - Quickly gather live data such as system processes, registry keys, network connections, and system logs. Learn the commands and tools that allow you to acquire this critical data before it’s lost or overwritten.</li>
    <li> Forensic Imaging - Learn to create forensic images of drives and other storage media directly from the command line. The ability to capture bit-for-bit copies of digital evidence without altering the original data is essential in preserving the integrity of evidence.</li>
    <li> Automating Data Collection with Scripts - The final step of the course introduces scripting. You'll learn to write basic scripts using batch files and PowerShell to automate the collection of data during an investigation. This automation is invaluable in ensuring that data collection is thorough, repeatable, and efficient, saving both time and resources.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading"> Who Should Attend? </h2>

<p> This course is ideal for anyone involved in digital forensics or incident response who wants to develop a deeper understanding of the command line interface within the Windows operating system. While the course is designed to start from an introductory level, it offers value to professionals with all levels of experience. You don't need prior command line experience—just a willingness to learn and the desire to sharpen your forensic skills. Although if this is your first experience with CLI, a helmet would be suggested, true beginners have been known to headbutt their keyboards. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> Why NCFI? </h2>

<p> The National Computer Forensics Institute (NCFI) is renowned for its hands-on, real-world training designed to meet the needs of digital forensics professionals.
