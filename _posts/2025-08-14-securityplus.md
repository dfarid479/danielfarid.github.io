<p>So remember when I wrapped up my Network+ journey and said Security+ was next? Well, I wasn't messing around. About a month later, I'm sitting here with a fresh Security+ certification and some thoughts on how this one compared to its networking predecessor. Spoiler alert: it was harder than I expected, but I somehow scored better. Go figure.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why I Jumped Straight Into Security+</h2>

<p>After finishing Network+, I was riding that certification high and wanted to keep the momentum going. Plus, all that networking foundation was still fresh in my head, which seemed like the perfect time to tackle Security+. The logical progression made sense - Network+ gives you the infrastructure knowledge, and Security+ teaches you how to protect it.</p>

<p>The one-month gap was actually pretty ideal. Long enough to decompress from the Network+ grind but short enough that I didn't forget everything about subnetting and routing protocols.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">My Study Setup: If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It</h2>

<p>I stuck with what worked for Network+ - Andrew Ramdayal's course on Udemy and Jason Dion's practice tests. Why mess with a winning formula, right?</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Ramdayal's Security+ Course: Still Gold</h2>

<p>Just like with Network+, Ramdayal delivered. The guy has a gift for taking complex security concepts and making them actually make sense. His coverage of cryptography, risk management, and incident response was solid. Coming from a digital forensics background, I appreciated how he connected the dots between theoretical security concepts and real-world implementation.</p>

<p>The course structure flows well through all the Security+ domains, and his examples helped bridge that gap between "book knowledge" and actual security work. If you used his Network+ course and liked it, this one's a no-brainer.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Dion's Practice Tests: What I wasn't ready for</h2>

<p>Here's where things get interesting. Dion's practice tests were great for getting familiar with the question format and testing my knowledge, but I've got to be honest - they were way easier than the actual exam. Like, significantly easier.</p>

<p>I was consistently scoring well on his practice tests and feeling pretty confident. Then the real exam hit me like a truck. Don't get me wrong, the practice tests are still valuable for learning the material, but don't let high scores give you false confidence about exam day.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Exam: Harder Than Network+ But Better Results?</h2>

<p>This is the weird part. Security+ felt noticeably harder than Network+. The questions were more scenario-heavy, required deeper thinking about security implementations, and just generally felt more complex. But somehow, I actually scored higher than I did on Network+.</p>

<p>Maybe it was better preparation, maybe the content aligned better with my forensics background, or maybe I just got lucky with the question mix. Either way, it was a pleasant surprise after walking out of the testing center feeling like I might have bombed it.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">NOT The PBQs all over again</h2>

<p>If Network+ PBQs were predictable and straightforward, Security+ PBQs are their chaotic cousin who shows up uninvited to family dinners. These things were everywhere:Incident response scenarios, Risk calculations, Security architecture stuff, Policy implementations and Crypto configurations. </p>

<p>Unlike Network+ where you could kind of predict what the PBQs would cover, Security+ threw curveballs left and right. They're less about following a formula and more about thinking like an actual security professional dealing with real-world chaos. My advice? Don't just practice the common scenarios. Try to think through different ways security concepts could be tested in a hands-on format. The variety will surprise you.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">For Fellow Digital Forensics Folks</h2>

<p>Our background definitely helps with Security+. The incident response knowledge, evidence handling procedures, and analytical thinking we use daily translate well to the exam content. But don't coast on that - the exam still requires focused preparation.</p>

<p>The certification is worth it though. It complements our forensics expertise nicely and opens up additional opportunities, especially if you're looking at federal work where Security+ is often a baseline requirement. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">In Closing</h2>

<p>Security+ was tougher than Network+ but totally manageable with the right preparation. Ramdayal's course remains excellent for building that foundational knowledge, but be ready for an exam that's harder than most practice materials suggest.</p>

<p>One month of evening study sessions got the job done, but I probably could have used a bit more time with diverse practice materials and PBQ prep. Still, mission accomplished - I'm now sitting on both Network+ and Security+ with a clear path forward in the cybersecurity world. </p>

<p>Next up? Probably going to take a short breather before diving into the next certification. But knowing me, "short breather" will probably turn into "okay, what's next?" within a couple of weeks.</p>
