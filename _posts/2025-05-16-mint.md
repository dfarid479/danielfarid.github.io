<p>As someone who does digital forensics for a living, I recently took the plunge and switched my personal laptop from Windows 11 to Linux Mint. This move was partly motivated by growing privacy concerns with Windows, but also just to understand Linux systems for networking practice.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Escaping Windows 11's Watchful Eye</h2>

<p>As providers incorporate their cloud services, we have to start asking what data is being collected and where it is going. Windows 11's data collection practices were starting to give me the creeps. Every click tracked, every search logged... it's like that annoying shoulder surfer. At work, I am constantly in the Windows filesystem sorting through the ocean of data available about the user, and the thought of that data being sent, owned, and maintained outside of my control is worrying.</p>

<p>Linux Mint offered a refreshing alternative with its minimal data collection philosophy. Plus, the Cinnamon desktop environment was familiar enough that I didn't feel like I'd been dropped onto an alien planet. It was more like visiting a foreign country where they speak with a funny accent but still serve recognizable food.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Power of FOSS: Freedom Matters</h2>

<p>One of the most transformative aspects of switching to Linux has been embracing Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). There's something deeply liberating about using software where the source code is available for anyone to inspect, modify, and distribute.</p>

<p>With proprietary software, you're essentially renting access to tools you depend on. The subscription service business model is not going away, and with more digital reliance, the inability to control the price could mean losing that subscription due to price hikes. With FOSS, you're part of a community that believes in digital freedom. Need to customize something? Go ahead! Curious how a program works? Look at the code! Worried about backdoors or privacy violations? The community has already inspected it!</p>

<p>This transparency has been particularly valuable for my digital forensics journey. Understanding how tools work under the hood helps me better understand the digital evidence they help me collect and analyze. Plus, there's something profoundly educational about being able to trace exactly what's happening with my data at each step. It's become a personal goal to lean more into the free and open-source community and start self-hosting my own services.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Data Retention: Taking Back Control</h2>

<p>I've become hyper-aware of the importance of data retention—both what to keep and what to discard. Windows 11's approach to data felt like hoarding everything indefinitely in some distant Microsoft server farm.</p>

<p>With Linux Mint, I control what information is stored, for how long, and where it goes. This shift in perspective has been eye-opening. I can now implement proper data lifecycle management on my own terms, keeping what's valuable while properly disposing of what isn't needed.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Learning Networking: The Linux Way</h2>

<p>One major motivation for switching was to get hands-on with networking in a Linux environment. There's something deeply satisfying about typing commands directly into the terminal instead of clicking through endless GUI menus. It's like the difference between driving an automatic and a manual car—suddenly, you feel more connected to what's actually happening under the hood.</p>

<p>Working with Linux has given me insights into network interfaces, IP addressing, and DNS resolution that I never would have gained through Windows' point-and-click interfaces. When something breaks (and things definitely break), the transparency of Linux means I can actually figure out why, rather than staring helplessly at a blue screen.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">My Growing Collection of Linux Tools</h2>

<p>Since making the switch, I've been like a kid in a candy store with all the networking and security tools available. Here's my current collection of digital toys:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Bat</strong> - A supercharged version of the 'cat' command with syntax highlighting.</li>
    <li><strong>Traceroute</strong> - Follows the path of packets across the internet.</li>
    <li><strong>Nmap</strong> - Network mapping tool that lets me scan my home network.</li>
    <li><strong>Albert</strong> - A keyboard launcher that boosts productivity.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Send</strong> - Transfers files across my devices without going through the cloud.</li>
    <li><strong>Veracrypt</strong> - Encryption software that keeps my sensitive files under lock and key.</li>
    <li><strong>Wine</strong> - Runs Windows applications on Linux.</li>
    <li><strong>Terminator</strong> - A terminal emulator with split panes.</li>
    <li><strong>DNSutils</strong> - A collection of DNS tools for domain name resolution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Bash Scripting Projects</h2>

<p>The switch to Linux encouraged me to develop some practical bash scripts that have enhanced my system management and troubleshooting skills.</p>

<p>I'm all about working smarter, not harder – which is why I created <code>system_maintenance.sh</code> to handle the tedious stuff. This script is like having a system butler that makes the rounds cleaning up temp files, updating software, and keeping everything running smoothly.</p>

<p>Network issues? I wrote a script to handle all those tedious diagnostic steps – from basic connectivity tests to full traceroutes – and wrap everything up in a neat report. It even builds a history file over time, so I can track patterns in network performance.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Learning Curve and Happy Accidents</h2>

<p>The transition hasn't been without its "what did I just break?" moments. There's nothing quite like the panic of accidentally typing the wrong command and watching your terminal fill with cryptic error messages. But these mishaps have actually been some of the best learning opportunities.</p>

<p>One night, after accidentally messing up my network settings, I spent three hours learning more about Linux networking than I had in the previous three weeks. Sometimes you have to break something to truly understand how it works!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>As I continue my journey with Linux Mint, I'm constantly amazed at how much I'm learning just by using my computer differently. My bash scripting adventures have evolved from "How do I make this computer do what I want?" to "Look at all the cool automated things I can make this computer do." </p>

<p>Also, I want to focus more on FOSS utilization—the open-source community has a ton of resources, and the ability to run services locally is looking powerful in a subscription-based future.</p>
