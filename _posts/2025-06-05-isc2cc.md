<p>After months of putting it off and making excuses about being "too busy with work," I bit the bullet and took the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) exam. I passed, and honestly, it wasn't as scary as I'd built it up to be in my head.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why I Decided to Take the Plunge</h2>

<p>As someone who's regularly knee-deep in digital forensics, you might wonder why I'd bother with what's essentially an entry-level cybersecurity certification. Fair question. The truth is, while I can tear apart a hard drive image like nobody's business, I realized I had some gaps in my broader cybersecurity knowledge. Plus, with the way our field keeps evolving, staying current with foundational concepts felt like a smart move.</p>

<p>The reality is that I have been studying for the Comptia Network + for a few months. While researching entry-level certifications, I came across the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) for FREE. As part of ISC2’s commitment to help close the cybersecurity workforce gap, ISC2’s new global initiative, One Million Certified in Cybersecurity, offers the exam at no cost. I figured I would use this exam to get used to the environment for Network+, and if I failed, I didn’t lose anything. </p>

<p>The CC certification covers five domains that form the backbone of cybersecurity: Security Principles, Business Continuity, Access Controls, Network Security, and Security Operations. Even though I work in forensics daily, I found myself wanting to shore up my understanding of areas like business continuity planning and access control frameworks.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Study Experience</h2>

<p>Here's the thing about the CC exam - it's designed for people with little to no cybersecurity experience, which initially made me think I could just wing it. While the concepts aren't rocket science, the way ISC2 frames questions requires you to think like them, not just know the material.</p>

<p>I spent about two weeks preparing, dedicating roughly 30 minutes each weeknight to study. The official ISC2 materials are solid, but honestly, they can be a bit dry. I supplemented with some YouTube videos and practice tests from various FREE sources. The key was understanding not just what the answers were, but why ISC2 considered them correct.</p>

<p>One thing that helped was relating everything to my forensics work. When studying incident response, I'd think about how it connects to the digital evidence I collect. When learning about access controls, I'd consider how they might impact my ability to acquire data during an investigation. Making these connections made the material stick better.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Exam Day Reality Check</h2>

<p>The exam itself is 100 questions, and you have two hours to complete it. I finished in about 60 minutes, which gave me time to review my flagged questions. The format is straightforward multiple choice, but don't let that fool you - some questions are tricky.</p>

<p>The questions felt fair, though some were definitely designed to trip you up if you weren't paying attention. Pro tip: read each question carefully and don't overthink it. ISC2 wants the "best" answer, not necessarily the most technically sophisticated one.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What I Actually Learned</h2>

<p>Beyond just passing the exam, I gained a more structured way of thinking about cybersecurity as a discipline in the private sector. In forensics, we often work backward from an incident to understand what happened. The CC certification helped me think more proactively about preventing incidents in the first place.</p>

<p>The business continuity section was particularly valuable. As forensics professionals, we're often called in when business continuity has already been disrupted. Understanding how organizations plan for and respond to these disruptions gives me better context for my investigative work.</p>

<p>I also appreciated the emphasis on governance and compliance frameworks. While I don't work directly with these day-to-day, understanding how they shape an organization's security posture helps me ask better questions during investigations.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Verdict</h2>

<p>Was it worth it? Absolutely. The CC certification won't revolutionize your career if you're already established in cybersecurity, but it provides a solid foundation and demonstrates your commitment to the field. For someone like me who specialized early in forensics, it helped fill in some knowledge gaps and gave me a broader perspective on cybersecurity.</p>

<p>The certification is also free (though you'll pay for study materials if you want them), which removes the financial barrier that stops many people from pursuing professional development. ISC2 clearly designed this as an entry point into their ecosystem, and it serves that purpose well.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>If you're on the fence about taking the CC exam, just do it. The time investment is reasonable, the material is genuinely useful, and having another credential never hurt anyone's career prospects. Plus, if you're already working in cybersecurity, you probably know more than you think you do.</p>

<p>The exam reminded me that cybersecurity is ultimately about people, processes, and technology working together to manage risk. As forensics professionals, we see what happens when those systems fail, but understanding how they're supposed to work makes us better at our jobs.</p>
