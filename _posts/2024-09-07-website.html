<p>In the digital age, having a personal website isn’t just a luxury—it's necessary to document your projects, showcase your skills, and learn new ones. If you’ve ever considered building your own site but were unsure where to start, I’m here to share my experience using a guide created by SpencerPao and leveraging GitHub Pages along with a Jekyll version of the Clean Blog theme by Start Bootstrap was created by and is maintained by David Miller (http://davidmiller.io/).</p>

<p>     Document Progress: Track and reflect on your growth over time, observing how your skills and projects evolve.</p>
