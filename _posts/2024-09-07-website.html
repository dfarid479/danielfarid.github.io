<p>In the digital age, having a personal website isn’t just a luxury—it's necessary to document your projects, showcase your skills, and learn new ones. If you’ve ever considered building your own site but were unsure where to start, I’m here to share my experience using a guide created by SpencerPao and leveraging GitHub Pages along with a Jekyll version of the Clean Blog theme by Start Bootstrap was created by and is maintained by David Miller (http://davidmiller.io/).</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why a Personal Website?</h2>

<p>     Showcase Projects: Organize your work to make it easy for potential clients or employers to view your skills and accomplishments.</p>

<p>     Learn New Skills: Building and maintaining a website is a fantastic way to gain hands-on experience with web development technologies.</p>

<p>     Document Progress: Track and reflect on your growth over time, observing how your skills and projects evolve.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reflecting on the Experience</h2>

<p>Building my personal website using SpencerPao’s guide and the Clean Blog theme was both an educational and rewarding experience. I gained practical knowledge in web development, learned how to manage a static site with Jekyll, and created a platform to showcase my work.</p>

<p>Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out, designing a personal website is an invaluable way to document your projects and learn new skills. With resources like GitHub Pages and Jekyll, creating a professional online presence has never been easier. So, take the plunge, and start building your own digital portfolio today!</p>

<p>Feel free to explore SpencerPao’s GitHub repository (https://github.com/SpencerPao) for more detailed instructions and customization tips. As a disclaimer, I'll be using this to practice my A.I. prompting skills. I plan to use several Large Language Models to assist in drafting the blog posts, so we will be able to see how good these models really are. Happy coding!</p>
